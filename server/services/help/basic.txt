O HAI I'm helping you. If you ever need help, just run the /help command. This will
invoke private help messages that only you will see.

Bunker has some commands that you can run from the chat message box.
Type a slash and then the command name, like this:

	/&lt;command&gt;

COMMANDS:
	help        	shows this message
	away        	set away status
	me          	make your avatar do something
	nick        	change your nickname
	topic       	change the topic of the room

For the full command list type '/help commands'

TOPICS:
	formatting  	how to format message text (italic, bold, etc)
	gravatar    	how to change your gravatar
	images      	how to upload an image to the room

To get help on a specific command or topic type '/help [command|topic]'.  Examples:

	/help nick
	/help images
	/help hangman
	/help fight
	/help leaderboard
